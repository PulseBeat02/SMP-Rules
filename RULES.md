## Rules

- (1) Be friendly and respectful. No racial slurs, derogatory language, offensive language, etc.

- (2) Spamming or constantly tagging Server Admins is discouraged. You will likely be muted as a result.

- (3) Please try to avoid religious/political talk on this server. It will likely lead to negative conflicts.

- (4) Posting links is allowed, as long as it doesn't lead to inapropriate content. (such as pornographic content)

- (5) Cheating, including using hacked clients or XRAY, is never allowed. This includes the following: 
	- Use of Hacked Clients
	- Use of Macros
	- Use of X-Ray
	- Looking at the Dynamic Map to try and Find Ores
	- Use of Autoclickers
	- Exploiting

	- Note: The following clients are the only clients that are allowed to be used:
        - Minecraft Launcher
        - Badlion Client
        - Lunar Client
        - More may be added. DM me a choice and I will take deep research about it.

- (6) Rules of War are split to the following ->
     - No stealing from others (NOT INVOLED IN THE WAR) during war.
         - The two sides must elaborate together on whether stealing is allowed. If one side says no, then NO its not allowed.
     - If harm/negativity was brought to another side, of course the side can strike back. However, make sure that it isn't an unfair trade.
         - Example: Stealing one paper for blowing up an entire base.
     - I want you guys to *try* and avoid griefing as much as possible. This rule has the word *try* for a reason. If one side greifs another by blowing
       up, burning, etc their base. Surely they can strike back with some similar effect. However, I don't want this server to be one where one person literally
       places a fire charge at someone's wooden base and burn it all (or attempting to *try* and create wars).
     - I want to address to not be stupid. I'm being serious here. This game is here for us to find a place to build, hang out, etc. If some people
       like to take the game seriously, just let them be serious. If I see a person with an intent of causing war to purposely try and destroy innocent people's
       builds, then of course I will be involved and deliver punishments. We are all human, so deal with it.
     - You may ask, how do I start a war then? Well, wars can be started from incrementing small escalations. What are small escalations? Small harm delivered
       to the opposing side, but not something big all of a sudden such as a massive base explosion out of nowhere.
       
- (7) What about stealing? If you aren't in a war (or not trying to start a war in *small increments*), stealing isn't allowed. 

- (8) Visiting someone's land is allowed, however placing or destroying of blocks without player consent is illegal. The only exception is when the person is giving  a gift to them, or the two sides are at war and as I described above, want to make payback to the opposing side.

- (9) So I had this problem originally, where I was dealing with two types of people. I realize that there are some people who just like playing the game, (and
don't want to affect others or let others affect them). There are also people who favor war. 
      - To fix this, I made a plugin called the war switch. This plugin gives you two plugins:
      - /status set peaceful
      - /status set war    
      - When in peaceful mode, you cannot be attacked and you cannot attack others. Others however can still modify your builds (so building can be easier), but if
      someone is doing it for a negative reason there will be punishments no matter what status they are. There is a **cooldown** between switching, where it takes
      24 hours to switch from war to peaceful. Switching from peaceful to war, there is a 20 minute cooldown which doesn't allow you to be attacked or attack others.
      However, after the 20 minutes, you will have the ability to do so. There is also **combat tags** on the server. It takes 30 minutes after being combat tagged to 
      use the command. The cmbat tag only activates if you attacked someone else. This is so people won't switch to Peaceful Mode in the middle of a battle/war.
      I coded it such that fist fights for fun won't trigger this. 

- (10) Keep all Minecraft account information private. We are not responsible to any items being lost.

- (11) Don't repost content -- it is illegal without author permission.

- (12) Don't go around asking server admins for items or just something in general.

- (13) THE RULES ABOVE APPLY TO IRC AS WELL

- (14) Violation of any of these rules will result in a warning, mute, kick, temp-ban, or ban.

**Note**: At the first week of the server opening, the end will not be allowed to avoid competition. After that, the end will be opened.
