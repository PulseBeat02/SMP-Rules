# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Question
Can I sit at other people's farm, afk there, and grab what I have afked for during the time?

### Answer
No. The builders of the farm built it for a reason. And they should deserve to use it. After all, they built for the reason
that they wanted to use it for their advantage, not for other people's advantage. Therefore, you cannot do this. However,
if it is a community farm (AND IT MUST BE STATED ON THE FARM AND BY THE FARM BUILDERS), you can use it.

### Question
Can I use zero tick farms?

### Answer
Absolutely not. Most of the 0 tick farms were abused from exploits. They are in fact patched in 1.16.4, so you cannot use them
in any way still.

### Question
If I spawn in a wither and it destroys their base, do I take the blame?

### Answer
Yes and No. Yes if it was clear it is on purpose (and again from the rules the act of "revenge" was not fair). No if it was a
random wither you were trying to kill for nether stars and it accidently got to someone's base. But you should pay for that,
and your bases shouldn't be close anyways. Additionally, you shouldn't ever have to fight withers close to your base -- do it
somewhere underground or in the Nether.

### Question
Can I self-moderate others?

### Answer
You shouldn't, and that isn't your job. I feel like sometimes there are some people who spam me rules (which I don't really care),
but when I spam them back as a joke they call it admin abuse (which I don't really care either). Don't be jerk. I will mute you if
you do it to me ever again. Sorry, but it ain't your server.

### Question
Does Pulse have the final say?

### Answer
Yes. He does. If he tells you to not do something (which is either against the rules or clearly marked as something used to make
the game unfair for others), then don't do it! Simple. I rarely ever have to do this, and I hope I don't have to because it's
annoying.

### Question
If the rules are changed from a later date, can I use the items I have used before? (Example: I steal sugarcane from other people. 
Then a new rule says that you cannot steal crops from other people's farms. Can I use this sugar cane still?)

### Answer
No. The rules are there to be followed, and it's your job to keep updated on them. I will occasionally send messages in Discord
as a reminder when the rules change, but if a new rule is added, it applies to everything (not just the old items).

### Question
Am I opped?

### Answer
Oh hell no.
