# Dynmap
## What is it?
Dynmap is a very useful plugin used for viewing the world online. The url for it is the exact same as the server address. 
Upon connection, you will have a live view of all players, chunks, and animals on the world. Possibly one of the most useful 
features is the chatbox on the bottom left corner. The chatbox allows direct 1 to 1 messaging between the server and the website,
meaning you can just connect to the website, and chat directly with players on the server on the website. You could be somewhere
in Canada and still chat with them by just connecting to the website and using the chatbox. This plugin is very useful, and very
nice to view the progress of builds once they come to exist.
