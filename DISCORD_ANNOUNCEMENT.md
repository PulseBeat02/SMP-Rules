Hello everyone, I would like to announce a Minecraft server opening today happening.

**Who am I?**
Ofc you guys know who I am lol. Well, I've been working with 3 other people who have worked with me before
on hosting smp servers. In the Minecraft plugin community, I have started to code new plugins which are
interesting to others. After the downfall of the first SMP, I would like you to introduce you to our new
server. 

**What are the Rules?**
The rules can be found here: https://github.com/PulseBeat02/SMP-Rules/blob/main/RULES.md (It is too
long to be posted in discord). We have very detailed rules here trying to cover a lot of vagueness 
(which is why it is so long). We want to understand that here at this server we need to have some
sort of civilness.

**What about Hackers?**
I have coded a plugin which disables **Fabric** and **Forge** users from joining. What is Fabric and Forge?
Fabric and Forge are modded clients which are used to play mods on. Most hack clients are very complex
mods which use these two modded clients, so disabling them will make it harder for hackers to hack. In
addition, I have installed an anti-xray mod meaning that xray will just not work at all. How is this
possible? Well, there is packet obsfucation, which is a bit too complex to talk about right now but
there's that.

**I don't want to be in war! I just want to be peaceful!**
After thinking many hours, I have decide to come to this solution. A group of thinkers and I have
came together and generated an idea of a very advanced plugin. What is this plugin you say? This
plugin is a status plugin, which has two commands:

/status set peaceful
/status set war

When you are in peaceful status, you cannot attack others and others cannot attack you. However,
when you are in war status, you can attack others that are also in war status, but you cannot attack
others who are in peaceful status. More information can be found in the rules section.
(I have coded it as well to include playful punches. The source code can be found here: https://github.com/PulseBeat02/SMP-Plugin)

**Other Important/Interesting Info**
I am making a rule where NOBODY will have OP. I mean NOBOODY. This will help eliminate bias and admin abuse. If you need proof
you can private message me on disccord and I will send you a screenshot or stream to you the server console.

Also, we have a plugin called Dynmap, which allows you to view a live map of the server. This is a website and it is
directly the same as the ip of the server. You can view all players, the map, animals, etc. You can also chat with 
other players on the server by using a chat box on the bottom left corner. This way you can directly chat to 
server members while also being on the website. The plugin also can identify who you are when you access the website,
so others will know who is speaking.
